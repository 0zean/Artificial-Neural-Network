# Artificial-Neural-Network Churn Model
ANN for predicting if a bank customer will stay or leave.

This project was made for Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves' course on deep learning.

This multilayer ANN churn model uses simulated data of banking customers to predict customer retention and utilizes parameter tuning to find the optimal hyperparameters (batch size, epochs, and optimizer) for the ANN.

**Requirements:**
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, keras, tensorflow, sklearn
