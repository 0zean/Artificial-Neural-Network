# Artificial-Neural-Network
ANN for predicting whether a bank customer will stay or leave

This project was made from Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves' course on deep learning.

This multilayer ANN uses a churn model in .csv form to predict if a customer will leave or stay with a bank and utilizes parameter tuning to find the optimal batch size, epochs, and optimizer for the ANN

**Requirements:**
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, keras, tensorflow, sklearn
